| [replace_quote.c](https://github.com/hystb/minishell/blob/main/pars/replace_quote.c) | The code snippet contains functions to replace and restore quotes in a given input string. The `replace_quote` function iterates through a list of commands, detects and removes quotes, and updates the content accordingly. The `restore_quote` function reverts the changes made to the quotes using the `change_quote` function.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

If the argument contains only'n' after the hyphen, it returns true, indicating that the option should not append a new line character at the end. `echo` function prints the arguments provided to it. It first checks for options using the `is_option` function and increments the counter for every valid option encountered. Then, it prints each argument, separated by a space. If no new line option is encountered, it appends a new line character at the end before returning `EXIT_SUCCESS`. |

The check_unset_str function validates the given string as a valid identifier, displaying an error message if it is not. The unset function removes environment variables based on the provided strings, deleting corresponding items from the list. It returns a value indicating any invalid identifiers encountered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [cd.c](https://github.com/hystb/minishell/blob/main/builtins/cd.c)                     | This code snippet implements the "cd" command functionality in a Minishell program.The "cd" function changes the current working directory based on the given path or the "HOME" environment variable. It uses the "chdir" system call and updates the "OLDPWD" and "PWD" environment variables accordingly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

It includes functions to check if a string contains an equal sign, validate the string as a valid identifier, extract the key from the string, and add the key-value pair to the environment variables. The code also handles multiple variables being passed as arguments to the export command.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [pwd.c](https://github.com/hystb/minishell/blob/main/builtins/pwd.c)                   | The code snippet implements the "pwd" command functionality in a shell program. It retrieves the current working directory path, prints it to the console, and returns success or failure codes accordingly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [exit.c](https://github.com/hystb/minishell/blob/main/builtins/exit.c)                 | The code snippet includes functions for handling the exit command in a minishell program. It contains functions to convert a string to a long long integer, check the syntax of the exit argument, and execute the exit command by exiting the program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [builtins.c](https://github.com/hystb/minishell/blob/main/builtins/builtins.c)         | The provided code snippet includes functions to check if a command is a built-in command, and execute the relevant built-in command. The supported built-in commands are "echo", "cd", "pwd", "export", "unset", "env", and "exit". The functions extract the arguments from the command and pass them to the respective built-in function for execution. The "do_builtins" function returns the exit status of the executed command.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
